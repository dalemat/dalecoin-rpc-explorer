# DALECOIN RPC Explorer

Simple, database-free DALECOIN blockchain explorer, via RPC. Built with Node.js, express, bootstrap-v4.

This tool is intended to be a simple, self-hosted explorer for the BSHA3 blockchain, driven by RPC calls to your own bsha3d node. This tool is easy to run but currently lacks features compared to database-backed explorers.

With this explorer, you can not only explore the blockchain (in the traditional sense of the term "explorer"), but also explore the functional capabilities of your own node.

# Features

* Browse blocks
* View block details
* View transaction details, with navigation "backward" via spent transaction outputs
* View JSON content used to generate most pages
* Search supports transactions, blocks, addresses
* Optional transaction history for addresses by querying configurable ElectrumX servers
* Mempool summary, with fee, size, and age breakdowns
* RPC command browser and terminal

# Getting started

The below instructions are geared toward BSHA3, but can be adapted easily to other coins.

## Prerequisites

1. Install and run a full, archiving node. Ensure that your bsha3 node has full transaction indexing enabled (`txindex=1`) and the RPC server enabled (`server=1`).
2. Synchronize your node with the bsha3 network.
3. "Recent" version of Node.js (8+ recommended).

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/BSHA3/bsha3-rpc-explorer`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build`
4. Edit the "rpc" settings in [app/credentials.js](app/credentials.js) to target your node
5. Optional: Change the "coin" value in [app/config.js](app/config.js)
6. Optional: Add an ipstack.com API access key to [app/credentials.js](app/credentials.js). Doing so will add a map to the /peers page.
7. `npm start` to start the local server
8. Visit http://127.0.0.1:3002/

## Run via Docker

1. `docker build -t bsha3-rpc-explorer .`
2. `docker run -p 3002:3002 -it bsha3-rpc-explorer`
